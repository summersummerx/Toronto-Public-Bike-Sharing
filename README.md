# Toronto-Public-Bike-Sharing

Motivation: the project took a close look at the public bike sharing situation in Toronto with a few insights generated to help future bike renters or even public officials:
1. More bike stations are available in the city, and more bike trips are made each year.
2. The most popular bike stations across the years are close to train station, or close to huge public parking lot off highway or close to water taxi station.
3. Bike trip duration has become shorter potentially due to the more easily accessible bike stations.
4. Bike trip duration is not associated with time of the year.
